# 3D Swift Snake

3D swift snake is an application that, with the companion of a physical device, allows the user to play snake on a cube.
The cube has a screen on each of its faces and the snake can switch from one screen to the other.

The rules for '3D Swift Snake' are the same as the ones for the original snake game:
- If the snake head touches the body you lose 
- If you 'eat' you grow

To play the game you need to connect your iPhone to the device (Bluetooth) and use it as a controller to move the snake.

You can use the on screen buttons or your device accelerometers to control the game, 
as you move the snake you'll fell a vibration to let you know the movement was detected correctly.

On the application you can also choose the game speed, decreese it to make it more difficult!!!
